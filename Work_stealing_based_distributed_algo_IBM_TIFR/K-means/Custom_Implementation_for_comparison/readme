1.Change the parameters in the main according to the input 
2.dirpath is the location of input files FOr eg:"user1/" or "movie1/"
3.limit is used for appending the zeros to the rowindex to generate file name ,Change the limit according to the max. no. of rows possible 
  For e.g if no. of rows are 1682 and the filenames are like 0001 ,0002 ..........1681 ,1682 etc.
  Then limit should be 1000;(there is a procedure for this - factlimit)
  but in user1 ,no of rows are 943 , but the files names are going from 0001 to ...0943, so provide limit for such cases explicitly .For e.g 1000 in this cases.
4.typedef struct {
	int mode;
	int lb;
	int ub;
	Data dt;
	float cent_rv[NUMCENTROIDS][NUMCOLS]; //Array for holding sum of different dimensions for the recomputation for a centroid
	int totalpts[NUMCENTROIDS]; //Array for holding total no. of points near to a centroid
	float mean[NUMCOLS]; //Mean for every Attribute based on data points
} divideattr;

These static arrays dimensions should be changed according to the input
