This code implements three multi-threaded algorithms (BFS, DFS, Shiloach-Vishkin(SV)) that compute 
the spanning tree of a random connected graph. It is used to test X10's support for fine-grained 
parallelism.

To compile the code:
 1) javac X10AtomicInt.java (If it hasn't been done sox)
 2) x10c -classpath . Span.x10 (add proper x10c flags if needed)

To run the code:
 1) x10 -classpath . -INIT_THREADS_PER_PLACE = ttt Span 
	* ttt is the initial number of Java threads allocated to thread pool 
		for a single place (default= 3)	
	* add other x10 flags if needed
